# Introduction

This bookdown is thought as accompanying material for the course on *High-dimensional statistics*. 
Much of the content is based on the book from @elements. The course has a focus on applications using **R** [@R-base].

What is high-dimensional statistics? The Statistics Department of the University of California, Berkeley summarizes it as follows:

*High-dimensional statistics focuses on data sets in which the number of features is of comparable size, or larger than the number of observations.  Data sets of this type present a variety of new challenges, since classical theory and methodology can break down in surprising and unexpected ways.*

High-dimensional statistics is often paraphrased with the expression $p>>n$ which refers to a linear regression setting where the number of covariates $p$ is much larger than the number of samples $n$. Nevertheless, challenges with standard statistical approaches already appear when $p$ is comparable to $n$ and in more complex models issues due to high-dimensionality often manifest itself in a more subtle manners.

High-dimensional data are omnipresent and the approaches which we will discuss find applications in many disciplines. In this course we will explore examples from molecular biology, health care, speech recognition and financial time series. 

We find it instructive to distinguish between *two tasks* of high-dimension statistics. The first task considers many explanatory variables $X_1,\ldots,X_p$ and one response variable $Y$. The goal is to predict the response and to identify the most relevant covariates. We refer to this task as *Prediction and Feature Selection*. The second task considers one (or few) explanatory variable $X$ and many response variables $Y_1, \ldots, Y_p$. The aim is to identify those variables which differ with respect to $X$ (e.g. treatment groups A vs B). We refer to this task as *Feature Assessment*.
